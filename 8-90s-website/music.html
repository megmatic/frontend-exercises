        <p>“I Will Always Love You” was covered by Whitney Houston and recorded for her 1992 film The Bodyguard. The song was originally written by Dolly Parton and released on June 6, 1974 as the second single from her thirteenth solo studio album, Jolene. Houston’s cover has since become one of the best-selling singles of all time and contributed to The Bodyguard being the top-selling soundtrack of all time. Kevin Costner, Houston’s male opposite and one of the film’s co-producers, is actually responsible for suggesting this song for Houston to cover in the film’s first track release. He brought the original song to composer David Foster, who rearranged it as a pop ballad for Houston. It topped the Billboard Hot 100 for fourteen consecutive weeks; at the time, this was a record for longest number one. It also reached #3 on the Hot 100 after Houston’s death in 2012.</p>
