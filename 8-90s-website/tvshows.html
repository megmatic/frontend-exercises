        <p>Will Smith more or less plays himself in this good-natured NBC sitcom. As the show's popular theme song explains, fictional Will's mom sends him away from his rough Philadelphia neighborhood to live with wealthy Uncle Phil and Aunt Vivian in Bel-Air. Will often has fun at the expense of stuck-up cousins Carlton and Hilary.

James Kirk, a less volatile and more mature Capt. Jean-Luc Picard heads the crew of various humans and alien creatures in their adventures in space -- the final frontier.</p>

        <p>Tia and Tamera are twins who were separated at birth, with each being adopted by a different parent. One day, the teens have a chance encounter while shopping at a clothing store in the mall. After the families meet, Tamera's adoptive father reluctantly allows Tia and her mother to move into his home so the girls can be together. But just because they're twins doesn't mean Tia and Tamera are identical in any way other than looks -- Tia is intelligent and from inner-city Detroit while Tamera is the boy-crazy twin from the suburbs.</p>
